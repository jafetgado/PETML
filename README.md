# DeepPETase Design
### Predicting PET-hydrolase activity from protein sequence with semi-supervised learning
-----------------

This repository contains all scripts and data for experiments, design, and analyses
in building the deep-learning package, DeepPETase.


## File/directory structure
---------------------

- Lower-level python scripts are in `module/` including `utils.py` and `models.py`.
- `module/`: contains lower-level python scripts including `utils.py` and `models.py`
- `experiment/`: contains scripts and data for experimental design of DeepPETase.
- `experiment/python_scripts`: contains the high-level python scripts used in design. 
These are organized in sequential order of the experimental process.
